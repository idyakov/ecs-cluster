VPC - Virtual Private Cloud	(if Internet Gateway does not attach, the system without Internet
	VPC - CIDR blocks
	Public Subnet this is part of the network which does have direct access to the Internet and have Ip public interface
	
Private Subnet does not have access through the Internet and although it does not have any access through access tools, like 		a SSH, RDP connection

	Database Subnet does not have to private and public access
	Route Table it's a list of ip's route 

	Internet Gateway - interface which has the access to the Internet

	NAT Gateway - it's flexible  management for implemantation of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header
	NAT Instance - it's a server 

	Security Group - it's a Firewall  - a system with network rules, it's can allow the port to the Internet and can make a rule with denied 			the access to the internet
	Network Access Control List it's a system which we can open the port on the in and Out (and it's can be added on the Subnet, 		but does not to the Instance separately)

	Bastion Host	- the system of network, if we need the access to all network, we can allow access for just one Server, and when he will be connected on the server, he can do access to all servers within this network through the main server 
	VPC Flow Logs it's option when we logging the network access in out level or all network traffics to the log file (for example on the  S3 bucket )
	VPN Gateway it's a connection between servers, computers through the private gateway, (it's not Bastion host)
	VPC Peering how to connect to networks


VPC - Virtual Private Cloud
	VPC CIDR block
	10.0.0.0/16 - 65.536 Ip addresses minuts 5 Ip adresses reserver by AWS
	10.0.0.0/24 - 24 IP  Ip addresses minuts 5 Ip adresses reserver by AWS
	10.0.0.0/28 - 16 Ip addresses minuts 5 Ip adresses reserver by AWS

	CIDR: 10.0.10.0/24
		10.0.10.0 Network  address.
		10.0.10.1	Reserver by AWS
		10.0.10.2	Reserver by Aws
		10.0.10.3	Reserver by Aws
		10.0.10.255	Reserver by Aws

	Local Network Ip Range
		10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
		172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
		192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

Public Subnet - all server does have Public Ip and direct access to the Internet
Privat Subnet - all servers do not have Public IP and have the access to the Internet through NAT
Database Subnet - all servers do not have PUblic IP and does not have the access to the Internet

	Subnet CIDR block should be into the zone of VPC CIDR Block
		VPC CIDR : 10.0.0.0/16
	Subnet CIDR:
			10.0.10.0/24 -> Servers IP range (10.0.10.0-10.0.10.255)
			10.0.11.0/24 -> Servers IP range (10.0.11.0-10.0.11.255)
			10.0.12.0/24 -> Servers IP range (10.0.12.0-10.0.12.255)
			10.0.20.0/24 -> Servers IP range (10.0.20.0-10.0.20.255)
			10.0.21.0/24 -> Servers IP range (10.0.21.0-10.0.21.255)
			10.0.22.0/24 -> Servers IP range (10.0.22.0-10.0.22.255)


VPC creation > Internet Gateway > Subnets - Modify auto-assign IP settings (this allows auto attach  Public ip for the instances) > Create route table - to set the Route table, need to allow all local network to access to the internet > Network ACL (Firewall outband inbound)
